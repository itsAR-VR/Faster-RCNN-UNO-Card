If you visit the website, you will find that there are two different versions of the dataset. They are:

raw: These contain the the original 8992 images.
v1: This is an augmented version of the dataset containing 21582 images.

To keep the training time short, we will use the original raw version of the dataset.

To be fair, the original version is not that small as well. It still contains almost 9000 images and around 30000 annotations. We have a good amount of data here.
